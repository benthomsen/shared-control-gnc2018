Simulations from "Shared Control Between Human and Adaptive Autopilots" presented at the AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference 2018

Created by Ben Thomsen in January 2018 to go along with paper:

Benjamin Thomsen, Anuradha M. Annaswamy, and Eugene Lavretsky. "*Shared Control Between Human and Adaptive Autopilots*", 2018 AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference, AIAA SciTech Forum, (AIAA 2018-1574)

Use this from the MATLAB command prompt like:

- `ARS = AnomalyResponseSim('act', 1)`
- `ARS = AnomalyResponseSim('del', 1)`

to simulate the cases with the sudden addition of first-order actuator dynamics and sensing time delay, respectively.
